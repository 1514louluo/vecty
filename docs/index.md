# Vecty: Introduction

Let's get started! Here's what you should read first before using Vecty:

-	[DOM Operations: the lowest level](dom_operations.md)
-	[Components: a composition of DOM operations](components.md)
-	[Rendering: how it works](rendering.md)
-	[Diffing: the algorithm](diffing.md)
- [Safety: rendering raw HTML safely](safety.md)
- [Sharing code: frontend & backend](sharing_code.md)
- [FAQ](FAQ.md)

## API Documentation

API documentation is available via [godoc.org](godoc.org) for every Vecty package:

- [github.com/gopherjs/vecty](https://godoc.org/github.com/gopherjs/vecty)

Because a few packages (namely `elem`, `prop`, and `style`) are auto-generated they can be quite verbose to view in godoc.org. Instead, we suggest that you install Go autocompletion for your editor of choice for searching these packages efficiently.
